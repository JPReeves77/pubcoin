## Project Description

Create a marketplace for loyalty tokens for breweries. Facilitate participating breweries creation of rewards tokens and provide a marketplace where they can be traded for others. 

*Add in NFT structure?* 

## Objectives / Project Questions to Answer 

- Contracts for: 
    - Boilerplate for each brewery to create a token 
    - Crowdsale for each brewery (provide option for crowdsale or auction?) 
    - Providing tokens as rewards
    - "Marketplace" 
        1. Set exchange rate (Based on ETH) 
        2. Have a global token? 
    - Random NFT boilerplate for each token? Or for the global token? 

## Data Sources (APIs, Datasets)

- Open Zeppelin 
- @TODO: Define which standards we want to use 

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
- Figure out the solidity contract structure. 
- Interaction Structure 
- Lightweight frontend for the breweries. 
- Define a path for each brewery participant to progress from joining the loyalty program, to providing end users with their tokens. 
    - Define a token using the ERC20 Standard. 
    - Define framework/contract for delivering tokens to customers. 
    - Define a framework/contract to utilize those tokens. 

- Slideshow 


Secondary:

- Randomized NFT incentive; occasionally a transaction might result in creating a new randomized, collectible digital object (anthropomorphised beer varieties?) which would be resellable and thus further incentivise consumer participation.

## Out of scope 
- Elaborate UI/UX implementation.
- Fully realized business model for the token / loyalty service.
